## What I can bring

- Effective collaboration with all teams. I have managed teams of up to 30 people and enjoy actively participating and making suggestions. I appreciate the startup atmosphere where everyone communicates with everyone (developers, marketing, product teams, etc.).
- Understanding of startup needs: speed, adaptability, etc., but I leave the final decisions to the CTO/CEO.
- Reliable: When I commit, I am 100% in.
- Interest in developments and innovations in the development field. I am ready to work with these technologies or make proposals.
- I like working with clean architecture to facilitate scaling.

## My experiences
- 2 years at Nooco as a front-end developer. A startup that measures the environmental impact of new construction, renovation, or operational projects.
- Many experiments and training sessions: On AI, Next.js, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Vercel, Supabase, Vercel, ...
- Demonstration of a SaaS with AI from scratch: www.powerpost.henriteinturier.com: Next.js (React with client and server side), Supabase (PostgreSQL database), Auth.js (authentication), Stripe (payment), Tailwind + Shadcn (style), OpenAI (AI for summarizing posts), Vercel (Deployment + CLI).*
