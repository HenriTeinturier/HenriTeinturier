👋 Hi, I’m @HenriTeinturier

As a developer specializing in React, NextJs, and TypeScript, I am looking to contribute to the development of startups.

I value teamwork and collaboration, convinced that the union of individual talents leads to collective success. Always available to help or answer questions from my colleagues, share knowledge, and learn from others to achieve excellence together.

I have specialized in React, Nextjs, TypeScript. I continuously train in my preferred technologies but also in the following areas: Mobile development, BaaS (Backend as a Service: Supabase, Firebase, etc.). I hold a Master's degree in STAPS and a Professional Title in Web and Web Mobile Development.

Some of my interests include:

🚀 Everything related to space and space exploration.  
🧬 Science (relativity, physics, the appearance and evolution of life, living beings, etc.).  
🎮 Video games.

🏀 A passionate basketball enthusiast, I have gained solid coaching experience. I have coached youth and adult teams at regional and national levels.

Basketball is a passion that has taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and self-improvement. These values are also present in my practice as a developer, where I always strive for excellence and to collaborate effectively with my colleagues.

💼 For over 10 years, I was a franchisee of a fast-food chain, where I managed a team of about thirty employees and achieved a turnover of €1M.

Curious and committed, I am always open to discussing new opportunities for collaboration or innovative projects in the field of web and mobile development.
